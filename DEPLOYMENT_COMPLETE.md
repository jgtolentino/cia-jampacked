# üöÄ JamPacked MCP Integration - Deployment Complete

## ‚úÖ System Status

All components of the JamPacked Creative Intelligence MCP Integration have been successfully deployed!

## üìã Deployment Summary

### 1. **Database Initialization** ‚úÖ
- SQLite database initialized with agent task queue schema
- Tables created: `agent_task_queue`, `agent_registry`, `agent_task_history`
- Default agents registered in the system
- Sample task created successfully

### 2. **Dependencies Installed** ‚úÖ
```bash
# Node.js packages installed:
- express, cors, multer (API server)
- googleapis (Google Drive integration)
- axios, uuid, sqlite3 (core functionality)
- ws (WebSocket support)
- node-cron (scheduled tasks)
```

### 3. **Core Components Ready** ‚úÖ

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| API Server | `api/jampacked-api-server.js` | Main REST API endpoints |
| MCP Handler | `mcp-integration/analyze-with-jampacked-handler.js` | Campaign analysis tool |
| Google Drive | `mcp-integration/google-drive-setup.js` | Awards data extraction |
| Awards Extractor | `mcp-integration/automated-awards-extractor.js` | Automated data sync |
| Award Models | `models/award-prediction-model.js` | Prediction algorithms |
| CSR Scorer | `models/csr-authenticity-scorer.js` | CSR assessment |
| Notifications | `mcp-integration/realtime-notifications.js` | Real-time updates |
| Versioning | `mcp-integration/analysis-versioning.js` | Reproducibility |
| Monitoring | `mcp-integration/performance-monitoring.js` | Performance tracking |
| Agent Relay | `mcp-integration/agent_relay.py` | Task dispatcher |

### 4. **Deployment Scripts** ‚úÖ
- `deploy.sh` - Start all services
- `stop.sh` - Stop all services
- `example_conversation.sh` - Test the integration

## üîß Next Steps

### 1. **Google Drive Integration** ‚ú® SIMPLIFIED!
Claude Desktop handles Google Drive access natively:
1. No service account needed!
2. Claude Desktop uses its built-in Google Drive integration
3. Just ensure the TBWA folder (ID: 0AJMhu01UUQKoUk9PVA) is accessible
4. See `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_DRIVE_GUIDE.md` for details

### 2. **Start Services**
```bash
# Start all services
./deploy.sh

# This will start:
# - API Server on http://localhost:3001
# - WebSocket Server on ws://localhost:8765
# - Performance Monitor
# - Agent Relay dispatcher
```

### 3. **Test the System**
```bash
# Run example workflow
./mcp-integration/example_conversation.sh

# Monitor task processing
watch -n 1 'sqlite3 ~/Documents/GitHub/mcp-sqlite-server/data/database.sqlite "SELECT * FROM active_tasks;"'

# Check API health
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

### 4. **Process Tasks**
The Agent Relay will automatically process queued tasks. To manually trigger:
```bash
python3 mcp-integration/agent_relay.py
```

## üìä Current System Status

```sql
-- Active agents in the system:
- JamPacked (analyzer)
- Claude Desktop (interface)
- Claude Code (processor)  
- Marian Trivera (researcher)
- Echo (communicator)

-- Pending tasks: 1
-- Task queue ready for processing
```

## üîó API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
