# JamPacked Creative Intelligence Platform
## AI-Powered Creative Effectiveness Analysis

### Overview

JamPacked Creative Intelligence is an autonomous AI platform for creative effectiveness analysis. It leverages Claude's advanced reasoning capabilities with comprehensive creative analytics to deliver marketing insights, predictive analytics, and ROI attribution.

### Key Features

- **Creative Effectiveness Analysis**: Comprehensive evaluation across multiple dimensions including strategic planning, creative excellence, and business results
- **Predictive Optimization**: Pre-launch campaign optimization to maximize effectiveness
- **Multi-format Support**: Compatible with all creative formats and platforms
- **Advanced Analytics**: Econometric modeling, incrementality testing, and cross-market normalization
- **Real-time Insights**: Dynamic performance tracking and optimization recommendations

### Core Capabilities

#### Creative Analysis
- Multimodal content analysis (images, videos, copy, audio)
- Brand asset recognition and tracking
- Memory encoding and recall prediction
- Creative effectiveness scoring

#### Advanced Analytics
- Media Mix Modeling (MMM) with attribution
- Incrementality testing and causal inference
- Cross-market performance normalization
- ROI optimization and budget allocation

#### Brand Performance
- Brand equity measurement and tracking
- Mental availability and category entry points
- Distinctive asset performance analysis
- Long-term vs short-term impact modeling

### Technical Architecture

The platform uses a modular MCP (Model Context Protocol) architecture:

- **MCP Servers**: Handle specific domains (creative assets, campaign performance, brand metrics)
- **AI Agent**: Claude-powered reasoning engine for analysis and insights
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL for structured data, vector store for embeddings
- **API Layer**: FastAPI endpoints for integration
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking and alerting

### Quick Start

#### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Anthropic API Key
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+

#### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/jgtolentino/cia-jampacked.git
cd cia-jampacked

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Verify installation
./verify_setup.py
```

### Usage

#### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/creative/analyze` - Analyze creative effectiveness
- `POST /api/v1/creative/optimize` - Get optimization recommendations
- `GET /api/v1/campaigns/{id}/metrics` - Retrieve campaign performance
- `POST /api/v1/brand/tracking` - Track brand metrics

#### Python SDK

```python
from jampacked import JamPackedClient

client = JamPackedClient(api_key="your-api-key")

# Analyze creative
results = client.analyze_creative(
    asset_url="https://example.com/video.mp4",
    campaign_objective="brand_awareness"
)

# Get optimization recommendations
recommendations = client.optimize_campaign(
    campaign_id="campaign-123",
    objective="maximize_roi"
)
```
