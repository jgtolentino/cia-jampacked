# ✅ Claude Desktop & Code Persistence Setup Complete!

## 🎯 What Was Created

I've created a complete persistence bundle that ensures Claude Desktop and Claude Code permanently remember your MCP + JamPacked + Google Drive setup.

### 📁 Persistence Bundle Location
```
/Users/tbwa/Documents/GitHub/jampacked-creative-intelligence/persistence/
```

### 🔧 Key Components

1. **`.mcp.yaml`** - Master configuration file
   - Defines all agents, services, and paths
   - Used by Claude Code to remember setup

2. **LaunchAgent Plists** - Auto-start on login
   - `com.tbwa.mcp.sqlite.plist` - MCP SQLite server
   - `com.tbwa.jampacked.services.plist` - All JamPacked services

3. **Monitoring Scripts**
   - `sync_agent_tasks.sh` - Monitors task queue every 5 minutes
   - `start_services.sh` - Ensures all services are running

4. **Configuration Files**
   - `claude-desktop-settings.json` - Claude Desktop preferences

## 🚀 One-Click Installation

```bash
cd /Users/tbwa/Documents/GitHub/jampacked-creative-intelligence/persistence
./install-persistence.sh
```

This will:
- ✅ Install LaunchAgents for auto-start
- ✅ Set up cron job for task monitoring  
- ✅ Create symlinks for Claude Code
- ✅ Configure logging
- ✅ Test database connections

## 🧠 How It Works

### Claude Desktop
- MCP SQLite extension auto-connects using saved DB_PATH
- Google Drive tasks delegated through native integration
- SQL shortcuts pre-configured for common queries

### Claude Code  
- Reads `.mcp.yaml` from home directory
- Knows all agent paths and capabilities
- Can dispatch tasks to agent_task_queue

### Background Services
- Start automatically on login
- Restart if they crash
- Monitor task queue continuously
- Process Google Drive extractions

## 📊 Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check if services are running
launchctl list | grep tbwa

# View service logs
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/jampacked-*.log

# Check task queue
sqlite3 ~/Documents/GitHub/mcp-sqlite-server/data/database.sqlite \
  "SELECT * FROM task_statistics;"

# Monitor agent health
watch -n 5 'sqlite3 ~/Documents/GitHub/mcp-sqlite-server/data/database.sqlite \
  "SELECT agent_name, status, last_heartbeat FROM agent_registry;"'
```

## 🔄 Testing Persistence

1. **Restart Test**
   ```bash
   # Restart your Mac, then check:
   ps aux | grep -E "(mcp-sqlite|jampacked)"
   ```

2. **Claude Desktop Test**
   - Open Claude Desktop
   - Run: `SELECT * FROM agent_task_queue;`
   - Should connect automatically

3. **Claude Code Test**
   - Open Claude Code
   - It should read `~/.mcp.yaml` automatically
   - Can reference JamPacked agents

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your MCP + JamPacked + Google Drive integration will now:
- ✅ Start automatically on login
- ✅ Survive system restarts
- ✅ Process tasks continuously
- ✅ Remember all configurations
- ✅ Work seamlessly between Claude Desktop and Code

No more manual setup required! 🚀
